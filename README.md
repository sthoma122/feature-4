Feature 4

Our Feature 4 consists of an app that lets you interact with two separate classes: people and location.
These classes contain information regarding people and places that the user can add to or remove.

The user must populate all field in order to submit new information.
The user is limited to ten items in each class as there is no need to have more than that for this feature.

To delete an item, the user must click the radio button labeled 'delete' underneath the item to delete.

Navigation between people and locations is done through the links at the bottom of the page.
